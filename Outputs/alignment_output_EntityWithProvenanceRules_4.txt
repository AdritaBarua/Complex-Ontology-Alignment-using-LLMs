To align the given Wikibase triple with the Enslaved ontology, we need to identify the corresponding concepts and properties in both ontologies and establish the relationships between them. Based on the provided information, we can derive the following alignment rules:

### Alignment Rules:

1. **Class Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q67` (Wikibase) is aligned with `EntityWithProvenance` (Enslaved).
     - **Rule:** `ed:Q67 ≡ EntityWithProvenance`

2. **Property Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/prop/P15` (Wikibase) is aligned with `hasLicenseInformation` (Enslaved).
     - **Rule:** `ep:P15 ≡ hasLicenseInformation`

3. **Domain and Range Alignment:**
   - The domain of `ep:P15` in Wikibase is `http://example.org/entity/Q67`, which aligns with `EntityWithProvenance` in Enslaved.
     - **Rule:** `Domain(ep:P15) ≡ EntityWithProvenance`
   - The range of `ep:P15` in Wikibase is `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement`, which needs to be aligned with a suitable class in Enslaved. Since `Statement` is not directly mentioned in the Enslaved ontology, we assume it aligns with a concept that can hold license information, which is `LicenseInformation`.
     - **Rule:** `Range(ep:P15) ≡ LicenseInformation`

4. **Additional Property Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/prop/statement/P15` (Wikibase) is aligned with a property that connects `Statement` to `LicenseInformation` in Enslaved.
     - **Rule:** `eps:P15 ≡ hasLicenseInformation`

5. **Class Alignment for License Information:**
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q433` (Wikibase) is aligned with `LicenseInformation` (Enslaved).
     - **Rule:** `ed:Q433 ≡ LicenseInformation`

These alignment rules establish a mapping between the concepts and properties in the Wikibase ontology and the Enslaved ontology, allowing for interoperability and data integration between the two systems.
