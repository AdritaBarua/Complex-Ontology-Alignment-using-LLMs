To align the given Wikibase triple with the Enslaved ontology, we need to map the concepts and properties from the Wikibase ontology to the corresponding concepts and properties in the Enslaved ontology. Let's break down the Wikibase triple and find the corresponding elements in the Enslaved ontology:

1. **Wikibase Triple Analysis:**
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q301` is labeled as "Place".
   - `http://example.org/prop/P8` is an object property labeled "hasPlaceType" with domain `Q301` (Place) and range `wikibase:Statement`.
   - `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` is a class.
   - `http://example.org/prop/statement/P8` is an object property labeled "place type value" with domain `wikibase:Statement` and range `Q205`.
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q205` is labeled as "PlaceTypeVocabulary".

2. **Enslaved Ontology Analysis:**
   - In the Enslaved ontology, `Place` is a class with the axiom `Place ⊑≤1hasPlaceTypeCV.PlaceTypeCV` (Axiom 14), which indicates that a Place can have a place type from a controlled vocabulary.
   - `PlaceTypeCV` is a class that represents a controlled vocabulary for place types.

3. **Alignment Rules:**
   - The concept `Q301` (Place) in Wikibase aligns with the `Place` class in the Enslaved ontology.
   - The property `ep:P8` (hasPlaceType) in Wikibase aligns with the `hasPlaceTypeCV` property in the Enslaved ontology.
   - The concept `Q205` (PlaceTypeVocabulary) in Wikibase aligns with the `PlaceTypeCV` class in the Enslaved ontology.

Based on this analysis, the alignment rules can be formulated as follows:

**Alignment Rules:**
1. `Q301` (Wikibase) ≡ `Place` (Enslaved)
2. `ep:P8` (Wikibase) ≡ `hasPlaceTypeCV` (Enslaved)
3. `Q205` (Wikibase) ≡ `PlaceTypeCV` (Enslaved)

These alignment rules establish a correspondence between the concepts and properties in the Wikibase ontology and the Enslaved ontology, allowing for interoperability between the two ontologies.
