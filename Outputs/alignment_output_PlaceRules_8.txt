To align the given Wikibase triple with the Enslaved ontology, we need to identify the corresponding concepts and properties in both ontologies and establish relationships between them. The provided Wikibase triple includes entities and properties related to "Place" and "PlaceName." Let's analyze the components and align them with the Enslaved ontology:

### Wikibase Triple Components:
1. `http://example.org/entity/Q303403` with label "PlaceName"
2. `http://example.org/entity/Q301` with label "Place"
3. `http://example.org/prop/P74` and `http://example.org/prop/statement/P74`
4. `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement`

### Enslaved Ontology Components:
- **Place**: Defined with axioms related to names, spatial extent, temporal extent, and provenance.
- **PlaceName**: Not explicitly defined, but can be inferred as a name attribute of a Place.

### Alignment Rules:
Based on the provided information, we can establish the following alignment rules:

1. **Aligning "Place" Concepts:**
   - Wikibase `ed:Q301` (Place) aligns with Enslaved `Place`.
   - Alignment Rule: `ed:Q301 ≡ Place`

2. **Aligning "PlaceName" Concepts:**
   - Wikibase `ed:Q303403` (PlaceName) can be aligned with the `hasName` property of the Enslaved `Place`.
   - Alignment Rule: `ed:Q303403 ≡ hasName`

3. **Aligning Properties:**
   - Wikibase `ep:P74` and `eps:P74` are properties related to statements about places. In the Enslaved ontology, these could align with properties like `hasDescription` or `hasAlternateName`, depending on the context.
   - Alignment Rule: `ep:P74 ≡ hasDescription` or `ep:P74 ≡ hasAlternateName`
   - Alignment Rule: `eps:P74 ≡ hasDescription` or `eps:P74 ≡ hasAlternateName`

4. **Aligning "Statement" Concept:**
   - Wikibase `wikibase:Statement` can be aligned with the concept of `EntityWithProvenance` in the Enslaved ontology, as both involve statements or records with provenance.
   - Alignment Rule: `wikibase:Statement ≡ EntityWithProvenance`

### Final Alignment Rules:
```plaintext
Alignment Rules:
1. ed:Q301 ≡ Place
2. ed:Q303403 ≡ hasName
3. ep:P74 ≡ hasDescription or ep:P74 ≡ hasAlternateName
4. eps:P74 ≡ hasDescription or eps:P74 ≡ hasAlternateName
5. wikibase:Statement ≡ EntityWithProvenance
```

These alignment rules establish a connection between the concepts and properties in the Wikibase ontology and the Enslaved ontology, based on the provided module information.
