To align the given Wikibase triple with the Enslaved ontology, we need to map the concepts and properties from the Wikibase ontology to the corresponding concepts and properties in the Enslaved ontology. Let's break down the given Wikibase triple and find the corresponding elements in the Enslaved ontology:

### Wikibase Triple Breakdown:
1. **Wikibase Class:**
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q410` is labeled as "Person".
   - In the Enslaved ontology, `Person` is a subclass of `Agent`.

2. **Wikibase Property:**
   - `http://example.org/prop/P33` is labeled as "hasPersonStatus".
   - The domain of this property is `http://example.org/entity/Q410` (Person).
   - The range of this property is `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement`.

3. **Wikibase Class:**
   - `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` is a class.

### Corresponding Enslaved Ontology Elements:
1. **Person:**
   - In the Enslaved ontology, `Person` is defined as a subclass of `Agent` (Axiom 1 in the Agent and Person module).

2. **hasPersonStatus:**
   - In the Enslaved ontology, the concept of "Person Status" is represented by `PersonStatusRecord`.
   - The property `hasPersonStatusRecord` is used to associate a `PersonStatusRecord` with a `Person` (Axiom 3 in the PersonStatusRecord module).

3. **Statement:**
   - The concept of a statement or record in the Enslaved ontology can be related to `AgentRecord`, which is a superclass for various record types, including `PersonStatusRecord`.

### Alignment Rules:
Based on the above analysis, we can propose the following alignment rules:

1. **Class Alignment:**
   - Align `http://example.org/entity/Q410` (Wikibase Person) with `Person` in the Enslaved ontology.
     ```
     Alignment Rule 1:
     Wikibase: http://example.org/entity/Q410 ≡ Enslaved: Person
     ```

2. **Property Alignment:**
   - Align `http://example.org/prop/P33` (Wikibase hasPersonStatus) with `hasPersonStatusRecord` in the Enslaved ontology.
     ```
     Alignment Rule 2:
     Wikibase: http://example.org/prop/P33 ≡ Enslaved: hasPersonStatusRecord
     ```

3. **Range Alignment:**
   - Align `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` (Wikibase Statement) with `PersonStatusRecord` in the Enslaved ontology.
     ```
     Alignment Rule 3:
     Wikibase: http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement ≡ Enslaved: PersonStatusRecord
     ```

These alignment rules map the concepts and properties from the Wikibase ontology to the corresponding elements in the Enslaved ontology, based on the provided module information.
