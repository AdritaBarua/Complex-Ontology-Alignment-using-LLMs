To align the given Wikibase triple with the Enslaved ontology, we need to identify the corresponding concepts and relationships in the Enslaved ontology that match the semantics of the Wikibase triple. The Wikibase triple describes a class labeled "PlaceName," which suggests a focus on naming places. In the Enslaved ontology, the concept of naming places is primarily captured by the `Place` and `PlaceCV` classes, which have properties related to names and alternate names.

Based on the provided modules and axioms from the Enslaved ontology, we can derive the following alignment rules:

### Alignment Rules:

1. **Class Alignment:**
   - Align the Wikibase class `PlaceName` with the Enslaved ontology class `Place`:
     ```
     Wikibase:PlaceName ≡ Enslaved:Place
     ```

2. **Property Alignment:**
   - Align the property of having a name in the Wikibase ontology with the `hasName` property in the Enslaved ontology:
     ```
     Wikibase:hasName ≡ Enslaved:hasName
     ```

3. **Additional Considerations:**
   - If the concept of `PlaceName` in Wikibase includes alternate names, align it with the `hasAlternateName` property in the Enslaved ontology:
     ```
     Wikibase:hasAlternateName ≡ Enslaved:hasAlternateName
     ```

These alignment rules are based on the assumption that the `PlaceName` in Wikibase is conceptually similar to the `Place` class in the Enslaved ontology, which includes properties for naming and alternate naming of places. The alignment focuses on the semantic equivalence of these concepts and their properties.
