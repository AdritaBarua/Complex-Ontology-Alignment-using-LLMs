To align the given Wikibase ontology triples with the Enslaved ontology, we need to identify the corresponding concepts and properties in both ontologies and establish the relationships between them. Let's analyze the provided Wikibase triples and align them with the Enslaved ontology:

### Wikibase Triple Analysis:
1. **ResearchProject**:
   - In the Wikibase ontology, `http://example.org/entity/Q172` is labeled as "ResearchProject".
   - In the Enslaved ontology, `ResearchProject` is a subclass of `Event` and `ProvenanceActivity`.

2. **hasName**:
   - In the Wikibase ontology, `http://example.org/prop/P20` is labeled as "hasName" and is an object property with domain `http://example.org/entity/Q410` and range `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement`.
   - In the Enslaved ontology, `hasName` is used in the context of `Place` and `Event`, where `Place` has a name as a string and `Event` has a name as a string.

3. **Statement**:
   - In the Wikibase ontology, `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` is a class.
   - In the Enslaved ontology, there is no direct equivalent for `Statement`, but it can be related to records or descriptions.

4. **full name as string**:
   - In the Wikibase ontology, `http://example.org/prop/statement/P20` is a datatype property labeled "full name as string" with domain `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` and range `xsd:string`.
   - In the Enslaved ontology, `NameVariant` has a property `fullNameAsString` with range `xsd:string`.

### Alignment Rules:
Based on the analysis, we can propose the following alignment rules:

1. **ResearchProject Alignment**:
   - Align `http://example.org/entity/Q172` (Wikibase `ResearchProject`) with `ResearchProject` in the Enslaved ontology.
   - **Rule**: `http://example.org/entity/Q172 ≡ ResearchProject`

2. **hasName Alignment**:
   - Align `http://example.org/prop/P20` (Wikibase `hasName`) with `hasName` in the Enslaved ontology.
   - **Rule**: `http://example.org/prop/P20 ≡ hasName`

3. **Statement Alignment**:
   - Align `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` with a concept in the Enslaved ontology that can represent a statement or record, such as `AgentRecord`.
   - **Rule**: `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement ≡ AgentRecord`

4. **full name as string Alignment**:
   - Align `http://example.org/prop/statement/P20` (Wikibase `full name as string`) with `fullNameAsString` in the Enslaved ontology.
   - **Rule**: `http://example.org/prop/statement/P20 ≡ fullNameAsString`

### Final Alignment Rules:
```plaintext
Alignment Rules:
1. http://example.org/entity/Q172 ≡ ResearchProject
2. http://example.org/prop/P20 ≡ hasName
3. http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement ≡ AgentRecord
4. http://example.org/prop/statement/P20 ≡ fullNameAsString
```

These alignment rules establish a correspondence between the concepts and properties in the Wikibase and Enslaved ontologies based on the provided module information.
