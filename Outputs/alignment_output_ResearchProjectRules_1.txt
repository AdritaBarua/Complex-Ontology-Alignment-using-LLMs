To align the given Wikibase triple with the Enslaved ontology, we need to identify the corresponding concepts and relationships in both ontologies. The Wikibase triple indicates that "Q172" is a class labeled "ResearchProject." We need to find how this concept aligns with the Enslaved ontology.

Based on the provided module information from the Enslaved ontology, we can see that "ResearchProject" is a subclass of "Event" and "ProvenanceActivity." Therefore, we can establish alignment rules between the Wikibase concept and the Enslaved ontology.

### Alignment Rules:

1. **Class Alignment:**
   - Wikibase: `ed:Q172` (ResearchProject)
   - Enslaved: `ResearchProject`
   - Alignment Rule: `ed:Q172 ≡ ResearchProject`

2. **Subclass Alignment:**
   - Since `ResearchProject` in the Enslaved ontology is a subclass of both `Event` and `ProvenanceActivity`, we can align these subclass relationships:
   - Alignment Rule: `ed:Q172 ⊑ Event`
   - Alignment Rule: `ed:Q172 ⊑ ProvenanceActivity`

These alignment rules establish that the Wikibase class `ed:Q172` labeled "ResearchProject" is equivalent to the `ResearchProject` class in the Enslaved ontology and inherits its subclass relationships.
