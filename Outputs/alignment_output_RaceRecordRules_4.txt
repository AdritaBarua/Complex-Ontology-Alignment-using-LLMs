To align the given Wikibase ontology triples with the Enslaved ontology, we need to identify the corresponding concepts and properties in both ontologies and establish relationships between them. Based on the provided information, we can derive the following alignment rules:

### Alignment Rules:

1. **Class Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q410` (Wikibase: Person) aligns with `Person` in the Enslaved ontology.
     - **Rule:** `ed:Q410 ≡ Person`

2. **Property Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/prop/P32` (Wikibase: hasRaceOrColor) aligns with `hasRaceRecord` in the Enslaved ontology, as both relate to race or color information associated with a person.
     - **Rule:** `ep:P32 ≡ hasRaceRecord`

3. **Class Alignment:**
   - `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Statement` (Wikibase: Statement) aligns with `AgentRecord` in the Enslaved ontology, as both represent records or statements associated with an entity.
     - **Rule:** `wikibase:Statement ≡ AgentRecord`

4. **Class Alignment:**
   - `http://wikiba.se/ontology#Reference` (Wikibase: Reference) aligns with `EntityWithProvenance` in the Enslaved ontology, as both involve references or provenance information.
     - **Rule:** `wikibase:Reference ≡ EntityWithProvenance`

5. **Property Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/prop/reference/P6` (Wikibase: isDirectlyBasedOn) aligns with `isDirectlyBasedOn` in the Enslaved ontology, as both properties describe a direct basis or source relationship.
     - **Rule:** `epr:P6 ≡ isDirectlyBasedOn`

6. **Class Alignment:**
   - `http://example.org/entity/Q67` (Wikibase: EntityWithProvenance) aligns with `EntityWithProvenance` in the Enslaved ontology.
     - **Rule:** `ed:Q67 ≡ EntityWithProvenance`

These alignment rules establish a correspondence between the classes and properties in the Wikibase ontology and the Enslaved ontology, facilitating interoperability and data integration between the two ontologies.
